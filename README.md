# Pixel-Art-Udacity
Final Project

Final Project for Udacity. Had fun. 

Didn't waste my time with git on my windows 10 comp as I do not use this one regularly. 
I use my Ubuntu laptop which this past week had a motherboard issue. I have ordered a 
new Dell Ubuntu powered laptop, but until then I will be using this beast with Atom. 
I was required to finish this course up in order to move onto an intermediate course 
I can move on so I made the decision to complete in this manner.
